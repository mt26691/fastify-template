# Fastify Database Best Practices

## Connection Management

- Use Fastify plugins for database connections
  - Register database connections as decorators
  - Ensure proper connection lifecycle management
  ```typescript
  fastify.register(dbPlugin, {
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
  })
  ```
- Implement connection pooling
  - Configure appropriate pool sizes
  - Monitor pool usage and adjust as needed
- Handle connection errors gracefully
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Use circuit breakers for resilience

## ORM/Query Builder Integration

### Prisma
- Use `@fastify/prisma` for integration
- Generate types from schema
- Implement proper error handling
- Use transactions for complex operations

### TypeORM
- Register as a Fastify plugin
- Use repository pattern
- Implement custom repositories for complex queries
- Enable query logging in development

### Knex.js
- Lightweight query builder option
- Use migrations for schema management
- Implement seed files for development data

## Query Optimization

- Use database indexes effectively
  - Index foreign keys and frequently queried columns
  - Monitor slow query logs
- Implement pagination for large datasets
  ```typescript
  fastify.get('/users', async (request, reply) => {
    const { page = 1, limit = 20 } = request.query
    const offset = (page - 1) * limit
    return await db.users.findMany({ skip: offset, take: limit })
  })
  ```
- Use database views for complex queries
- Implement caching strategies
  - Redis for session data
  - In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

## Data Validation

- Validate data at API level using JSON schemas
- Implement database constraints
  - Use foreign keys for referential integrity
  - Add check constraints for business rules
- Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection
- Use parameterized queries exclusively

## Migration Strategy

- Use migration tools (Prisma Migrate, TypeORM migrations, Knex migrations)
- Version control all migrations
- Test migrations in staging environment
- Implement rollback procedures
- Never modify existing migrations in production

## Transaction Management

- Use transactions for data consistency
  ```typescript
  await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const user = await tx.user.create({ data: userData })
    await tx.profile.create({ data: { ...profileData, userId: user.id } })
    return user
  })
  ```
- Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Keep transactions short to avoid locks
- Handle transaction failures appropriately

## Monitoring and Performance

- Enable query logging in development
- Monitor database performance metrics
  - Query execution time
  - Connection pool usage
  - Lock wait times
- Use database-specific profiling tools
- Implement health checks for database connectivity

## Security Best Practices

- Never store sensitive data in plain text
- Use environment variables for connection strings
- Implement row-level security where needed
- Audit database access and modifications
- Regular backup and restore testing
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit

## Multi-tenancy Patterns

- Schema-based isolation for complete separation
- Row-level security for shared databases
- Connection routing based on tenant
- Implement proper data isolation testing
